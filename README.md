# AWS OpstWorks PHP Cookbooks. 

# Summary
> "OpsWorks is a DevOps solution for managing the coplete application lifecycle, 
> including resource provisioning, configuration management, applcation deployment 
> software updates, monitori9ng and access cotrol."

This repository contains a small collection of recipes to help setup PHP application in OpsWorks.
Currently two PHP frameworks are supported: [FuelPHP](http://fuelphp.com) and [Symfony 2.x](http://symfony.com).

Supports Chef 11.10

Some of the cookbooks functionality include:
- Enable Memory Swap for micro instances.
- Create custom files to include environment variables using either .htaccess or php files. 
- Composer install and update.
- ACL setup for Ubuntu instances.
- FuelPHP database configuration for both OpsWorks Database layer and RDS.
- FuelPHP custom .htaccess template and environment variables.
- Symfony custom parameters.yml (currently only suports OpsWorks Database layer).
- Symfony custom .htaccess template and environment variables.
- Symfony configuration of writable directories (requires acl_setup).
- Startup Beanstalk and Supervisor to manage worker queues (requires beanstalk and suprevisor OS packages).  
- Adwords authentication configuration for PHP SDK. 


#Requirements
* Ubuntu Instances.
* Apache2.
* mod_env must be enabled. 

# Version
1.0.0

# Credits
Some parts of this code where taken from the [ace-cookbooks opsworks_app_environment](https://github.com/ace-cookbooks/opsworks_app_environment). Also see [this](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=118107).

# Installation
- In your OpsWorks stack settings enable **"Use custom Chef Cookbooks"**

# Cookbooks

##AdWords
This cookbook contains a recipe to place a configuration file in a location of your choosing with in the deployment directory. 

###adwords::auth_config

```
{ 
    "custom_env": {
        "app_name": {
            "adwords": {
                "path_to_auth": "app/config",
                "developer_token": "ThisIsTheDeveloperToken",
                "user_agent": "Custom User Agent",
                "client_id": "clientid.apps.googleusercontent.com",
                "client_secret": "ClientSecret",
                "refresh_token": "RefreshToken-MustBeRequested"
            }
        }
    }
}
```
Use on **setup**. The name of the authentication file will be auth.ini and will look like this:

```
developerToken = "ThisIsTheDeveloperToken"
userAgent = "Custom User Agent"

[OAUTH2]

client_id = "clientid.apps.googleusercontent.com"
client_secret = "ClientSecret"

; If you already have a refresh token, enter it below. Otherwise run
; GetRefreshToken.php.
refresh_token = "RefreshToken-MustBeRequested"

```

##cronjobs
This cookbook creates cronjobs based on configuration values

###cronjobs::default (experimental)
Default will create multiple cronjobs based on the following configuration values:

```
{
    "custom_env": {
        "cron_jobs": [  
            {
                // Send an email every sunday at 8:10

            },
        ]
    }
}
```

Use on **setup** and **deploy** life cycles.

For more information see the [AWS OpsWorks](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/workingcookbook-extend-cron.html) documentation.

All parameters are required.

##phpenv
This cookbook contains utility recipes to help setup applications.

###phpenv::memoryswap
AWS micro instances have little memory (615 MB), and can often times run out of memory. 
I have run into memory issues when doing composer installs or updates. 

Use recipe on **Setup** ONLY.

See these references for more info:
- [AWS Micro Instances](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts_micro_instances.html)
- [Using composer in AWS + Micro Instance](http://onema.io/blog/aws-micro-instance-and-composer/)
- [Adding Swap to any EC2 Instance](http://www.the-tech-tutorial.com/?p=1408)
- [Symfony2, Composer, Capifony and an EC2 Micro instance](http://jonathaningram.com.au/category/composerphp/)
- [ErrorException: proc_open(): fork failed - Cannot allocate memory in phar](https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/945)

###phpenv::php_mongodb
This recipe installs the mongodb php module using PECL (Requires the **php-pear** OS package). 

Use recipe on **Setup** ONLY.

###phpenv::php_redis
This recipe installs the redis php module using PECL (Requires the **php-pear** OS package). 

Use recipe on **Setup** ONLY.

###phpenv::htaccess_env_vars
This recipe creates a custom .htaccess in the directory of your choice and sets
environment variables using the apache setEnv directive. A default .htaccess file is
provided with this recipe, but a custom .htaccess file can be used. 
The recipe can create a unique .htaccess file for each application in the stack. 
Two configuration values are required to make this recipe work: ```htaccess_template``` for example htaccess.rb, 
and ```path_to_vars``` This is the path where the htaccess file will be created. 
The evironment variables can be set in the custom Chef JSON like this:

```
{
    "custom_env": {
        "staging_site": {
            "environment": "staging",
            "htaccess_template": "htaccess.rb",
            "path_to_vars": "web",
            "env_vars" : [ 
                "CACHE_TIME 3600", 
                "SOME_API_KEY BlahBlah", 
                "ANOTHER_API_KEY helloWorld!" 
            ] 
        },
        "production_site": {
            "environment": "production",
            "htaccess_template": "advanced_htaccess.rb",
            "path_to_vars": "public",
            "env_vars" : [ 
                "CACHE_TIME 1234", 
                "SOME_API_KEY nahnah", 
                "ANOTHER_API_KEY hello-monkey!" 
            ] 
        }
    }
}
```

The name custom_env is required. The values staging_site and production_site are the applications created in this stack and
must match the application name.

The array of values ```"env_vars"``` will have any environment variable needed to run the application. The format is

"KEY value" (KEY space VALUE)

in the example above the production site $_SERVER array would look like this:

```php
Array
(
//... 
    [ANOTHER_API_KEY] => hello-monkey!
    [GA_API_CACHE_TIME] => 1234
    [SOME_API_KEY] => nahnah
//... 
)
```

**NOTE: THE RECIPE WILL NOT WORK IF YOUR APPLICATION NAME HAS SPACES OR DASHES "-" BETWEEN WORDS. Use underscores "_" to separate words to avoid problems**
**NOTE2: THESE ENVIRONMENT VALUES WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE IN THE TERMINAL. ANY TASKS YOU RUN FROM THE TERMINAL MUST SET THE EVIRONMENT NAME**
The .htaccess generated by this recipe will look like this:

```
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine on 
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f 
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d 
  RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php/$1 [L] 
  
  <IfModule mod_env.c> 
    # Environment Variables for application production_site 
    SetEnv ANOTHER_API_KEY hello-monkey! 
    SetEnv GA_API_CACHE_TIME 1234 
    SetEnv SOME_API_KEY nahnah 
  </IfModule> 
</IfModule>
```

###phpenv::php_env_vars
This recipe creates a custom ```environment_variables.php``` in the directory of your choice and sets
environment variables using the [putenv](http://php.net/manual/en/function.putenv.php) function. 
In order to use this file and have the env vars available on every request, the file must be 
included each time. The recipe can create a unique file for each application in the stack. 
One configuration values is required to make this recipe work: ```path_to_vars```. 
This is the path where the ```environment_variales.php``` file will be created. 

The evironment variables can be set in the custom Chef JSON like this:

```
{
    "custom_env": {
        "staging_site": {
            "environment": "staging",
            "path_to_vars": "src/acme/application/config/staging",
            "env_vars" : [ 
                "CACHE_TIME=3600", 
                "SOME_API_KEY=BlahBlah", 
                "ANOTHER_API_KEY=helloWorld!" 
            ] 
        },
        "production_site": {
            "htaccess_template": "advanced_htaccess.rb",
            "path_to_vars": "src/acme/application/config/production",
            "env_vars" : [ 
                "CACHE_TIME=1234", 
                "SOME_API_KEY=nahnah", 
                "ANOTHER_API_KEY=hello-monkey!" 
            ] 
        }
    }
}
```

The name custom_env is required. The values staging_site and production_site are the applications created in this stack and
must match the application name.

The array of values ```"env_vars"``` will have any environment variable needed to run the application. The format is

"KEY=value" 


Note that in this case we do not add an environment value for FUEL_ENV, this is 
because the recipe will use the application value ```environment``` to set it. 

**NOTE: THE RECIPE WILL NOT WORK IF YOUR APPLICATION NAME HAS SPACES OR DASHES "-" BETWEEN WORDS. Use underscores "_" to separate words to avoid problems**
**NOTE2: THESE ENVIRONMENT VALUES WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE IN THE TERMINAL. ANY TASKS YOU RUN FROM THE TERMINAL MUST SET THE EVIRONMENT NAME**
The ```environment_variables.php``` generated by this recipe will look like this:

```
    // Environment Variables for application production_site 
    putenv("ANOTHER_API_KEY hello-monkey!");
    putenv("FUEL_ENV production");
    putenv("GA_API_CACHE_TIME 1234");
    putenv("SOME_API_KEY nahnah");
```

##composer
This coockbook contains recipes to run the install and update commands. 

###composer::install
This will download the latest version of composer from [https://getcomposer.org/installer](https://getcomposer.org/installer) 
to the current deployment directory and will run ```$ php composer.phar install --optimize-autoloader```.

###composer::update
Similar to install this recipe will download the latest version of composer from [https://getcomposer.org/installer](https://getcomposer.org/installer) 
to the current deployment directory and will run ```$ php composer.phar update```.

##fuel
This is a collection of recipes for the FuelPHP framework.

###fuel::env_vars
**Deprecated, use phpenv::htaccess_env_vars or phpenv::php_env_vars** 

Currently it is not possible to setup Environment Variables for PHP stacks in 
Amazon Web Services OpsWorks. This recipe creates a custom .htaccess in the public 
dicrectory and sets environment variables using the apache setEnv directive. The 
recipe can create unique .htaccess file for each application in your stack. 
The evironment variables can be set in the custom Chef JSON like this:

```
{
    "custom_env": {
        "staging_site": {
            "environment": "staging",
            "env_vars" : [ 
                "CACHE_TIME 3600", 
                "SOME_API_KEY BlahBlah", 
                "ANOTHER_API_KEY helloWorld!" 
            ] 
        },
        "production_site": {
            "environment": "production",
            "env_vars" : [ 
                "CACHE_TIME 1234", 
                "SOME_API_KEY nahnah", 
                "ANOTHER_API_KEY hello-monkey!" 
            ] 
        }
    }
}
```

The name custom_env is required. The values staging_site and production_site are the applications created in this stack and
must match the application name.

The array of values ```"env_vars"``` will have any environment variable needed to run the application. The format is

"KEY value"

in the example above the production site $_SERVER array would look like this:

```php
Array
(
//... 
    [FUEL_ENV] => production
    [ANOTHER_API_KEY] => hello-monkey!
    [GA_API_CACHE_TIME] => 1234
    [SOME_API_KEY] => nahnah
//... 
)
```

Note that in this case we do not add an environment value for FUEL_ENV, this is 
because the recipe will use the application value ```environment``` to set it. 

**NOTE: THE RECIPE WILL NOT WORK IF YOUR APPLICATION NAME HAS SPACES OR DASHES "-" BETWEEN WORDS. Use underscores "_" to separate words to avoid problems**
**NOTE2: THESE ENVIRONMENT VALUES WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE IN THE TERMINAL. ANY TASKS YOU RUN FROM THE TERMINAL MUST SET THE EVIRONMENT NAME**
The .htaccess generated by this recipe will look like this:

```
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine on 
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f 
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d 
  RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php/$1 [L] 
  
  <IfModule mod_env.c> 
    # Environment Variables for application production_site 
    SetEnv ANOTHER_API_KEY hello-monkey! 
    SetEnv FUEL_ENV production 
    SetEnv GA_API_CACHE_TIME 1234 
    SetEnv SOME_API_KEY nahnah 
  </IfModule> 
</IfModule>
```

###fuel::migrate
This will run the FuelPHP database migration script ```env FUEL_ENV=environment php oil r migrate```. 
The "environment" will be the one set in the custom Chef JSON.

###fuel::rdsconfig
If you have correctly setup RDS to work with OpsWorks instances, use this recipe 
to create a database configuration file db.php in the correct environment directory. 
The Database values are set in the custom Chef JSON:

```json
{ 
    "custom_env": {
        "production_site": {
            "environment": "production",
            "database": {
                "dbname": "dbname", 
                "host": "mydatabase.abcd1234.region.rds.amazonaws.com", 
                "user": "username", 
                "password": "p@55w0rD",
                "port": "3306"
           },
            "env_vars" : [ 
                ...
            ]
        }
    }
}
```
In this example the file will be created in ```current/fuel/app/config/production/db.php```.
If the environment is set to staging it will be created in ```current/fuel/app/config/staging/db.php```.

###fuel::dbconfig
If a OpsWorks Database layer is used intead of RDS use this recipe to create the db.php 
config file in the correct environment dicrectory. There is no need to create a custom Chef JSON entry 
for this recipe as OpsWorks provides this information internaly via ```deploy[:database]```.

###fuel::ses
This recipe creates a configuration file for the [alleluu/fuel-aws-ses](https://github.com/alleluu/fuel-aws-ses) package.
This recipe uses the custom Chef JSON ```"ses"``` entry to setup the file. This file is created in the root config directory (it is not environment specific)

```json
{ 
    "custom_env": {
        "production_site": {
            "environment": "production",
            "ses": {
                "access_key": "SDFGHJKL", 
                "secret_key": "DFGH123456POIUY0987"
           }
        }
    }
}
```

##workers
Recipes to startup beanstalkd and supervisor.

###workers::supervisor
Starts up supervisor using the configuration file that must be located in the root of the project. 

###workers::beanstalkd
Starts up beanstalkd.

##symfony
This cookbook contains a collection of recipes to help setup a symfony 2 application. 

###symfony::acl_setup
This recipe installs acl.

###symfony::configure
This recipe requires acl_setup. This recipe should be broken down into multiple ones as it is currently a collection of multiple actions:
- It gives the symfony application write access to  ```app/cache/*``` and ```app/logs/*```. 
- Creates custom .htaccess to setup environment variables similar to the env_vars recipe for FuelPHP.
- Downloads Composer and runs install command. 
- Includes the symfony::paramconfig recipe
- Executes `php app/console cache:clear --env=prod --no-debug` if the `warmup_cache` option is **defined** in the application configuration

```json
{ 
    "custom_env": {
        "production_site": {
            // ...
            "warmup_cache": true,
            // ...
        }
    }
}
```


###symfony::paramconfig
This recipe creates a custom parameters.yml using values from the custom Chef JSON entry ```"parameters"```:
```json
{ 
    "custom_env": {
        "production_site": {
            "values" : [ 
                // for custom environment values 
            ],
            "parameters" : [ 
                "locale: en",
                "database_name: my_database_name"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```
